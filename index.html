                <p>Welcome to my e-portfolio! Here you can find a variety of artifacts that demonstrate some of the many skills I have acquired throughout my professional and academic career. My design and development skills are showcased at the top of my page, featuring most prominently grammar assessments I have created. I worked on not just incorporating a variety of design skills to demonstrate the many aesthetics a company could include, but I also incorporated curriculum elements aligning to Florida B.E.S.T. standards. There is a more detailed description of each artifact below. </p>
