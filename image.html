                <p>For this project I created a business logo for the fictional business Reposeful Hotel and a new book cover for “The Hunger Games.”</p>
				<img src="Logo.jpg" alt="Logo for fictional hotel Reposeful Hotel created by Alexandra McDermott" width="800" height="500" style="display:block; margin:auto"/>
                <p>For my business logo, I created a logo for a sleek, modern hotel with bold colors, intense lines, and shapes to represent the modern edge. I utilized Inkscape for this project. The boundaries for my logo are a blue circle with a 12 point black star the same size as the circle. I also gave the star a bevel point and a 0.15 spoke ratio to make the background look like a wheel.  The colors are dark and moody to give a mature feeling. I added the letters RH to represent the Reposeful Hotel in the center of the logo with white text. I finished the logo by adding a smaller ringed circle in an emerald green. I chose a color that complimented the other colors with still standing out amongst them. The ring also draws the eye towards the center of the logo aka the letters. This project challenged me by having me focus on how every aspect of an image is important. Not only do I find it crucial to focus on the details, but the details truly mean everything. If I had slightly different color choices are not as dramatic of a background, the whole essence of the company would feel different. Every detail, including the font of the text is important. This attention to detail demonstrates my focus and willingness to go above and beyond to ensure the details are there.</p>
                <img src="Cover.jpg" alt="The Hunger Games book cover created by Alexandra McDermott" width="650" height="800" style="display:block; margin:auto"/>  
                <p>     For my book cover, I utilized GIMP with images from Flickr (the mocking jay, flames, and a purple drink). I used flames as the background for my book cover as it is a major motif throughout the book series. Katniss Everdeen, the main character, is nicknamed “the girl on fire,” and having the flames as the background connects strongly to that. On top of the flames, I placed a mocking jay at 60% opacity. I also removed the background of the image. The mocking jay was chosen again as a symbol of Katniss Everdeen as well as an homage to the original book cover. As with my logo, every detail matters. I used the font Silom found within the GIMP system to write my title and author’s name. This font has a modern feel that represents the dystopian, futuristic setting of the novel. Finally, I added a purple drink at 90% opacity in the upper corner. The drink represents the opulence of the capital and, in theory, as the book covers progress the drink would become more engulfed by flames.  This also represents Katniss being forced to partake in the Capitol affairs, a drink pouring towards the mocking jay, but her resentment is demonstrated by the flames beginning to engulf. This part of the project helped me understand how to apply symbolism to book covers. I have often spoken of the importance of text features, found in the B.E.S.T. ELA standards from kindergarten to 12th grade. By truly working with symbols of the text to identify the pieces of the cover, I took a deep dive into the aspects of creation in relation to text. This project is a great resource for teachers as it has students thoroughly understand not only what they are reading but how they can apply their own text features to the stories.</p>
