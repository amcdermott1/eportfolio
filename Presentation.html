                <p>The following Nearpod was created to provide students an engaging and informative way to learn about or reinforce their knowledge on elaboration in writing. This Nearpod was designed to take place over multiple days and give students a variety of examples for practice. It includes a pre and post test as well as a lesson reinforcing skills and strategies. Furthermore, there is a space theme throughout the entire presentation to engage students and interest them in a part of writing that students typically find uninteresting. This project demonstrates my ability to adapt curriculum pieces as well as create new curriculum to support studnets' needs. ></p>
