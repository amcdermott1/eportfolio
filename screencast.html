                <p> For this project, I decided to move away from creating strictly products for students to use and created a tutorial for teachers. As someone who works with curriculum content frequently, video tutorials are often helpful in helping me identify how to best utilize the features of the program I am working with. I wanted to mimic this by demonstrating a feature of Google Sheets I use frequently, conditional formatting. Conditional formatting in the case of this tutorial is highlighting the cells of a spreadsheet in different colors to represent how students performed on a test. I also included a clear, thorough narration to walk the watchers through the process. In terms of editing effects I added with Camtasia, the app I utilized to record and edit the video, there were a variety. For my cursor, I added a highlight and smoothing effect for steps two through four of the process. This allows for the mouse to not bounce around the screen as much and provides a clear focus on where I am clicking as I say it. In terms of special effects, I also included the smart focus feature for steps two through four and the demonstration of the data working. Since my spreadsheet does not have a lot of data, the smart focus feature zooms in on just the important parts. As this was the third video-based project I have completed in this class, it went a lot faster than my other two video-based projects. I was able to quickly adapt to Camtasiaâ€™s format and include editing details in a meaningful way. This project also helped refresh my skills in teaching adults as they do not need the same descriptive language that students need. When working in curriculum content creation, creating content for the teachers is also a valuable skill. I utilized this project to showcase that I can also make content catered towards adults and demonstrate skills that are applicable to their average workday. I utilize conditional formatting frequently to not just identify student data at a glance but also to identify how I should pull small groups for different standards. I was challenged to think creatively and critically about how to create and edit a logical screencast. </p>
