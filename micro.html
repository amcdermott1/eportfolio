                <p>Here is a detailed description on my knowledge-based microcredential proposal, Teaching Argumentative Writing to New, Elementary Writers. </p>
				
<p>Overview: This project’s goal is to educate teachers and coaches on what the key parts of argumentative writing are and how to introduce the parts of argumentative writing to upper elementary students. It aims to support teachers through instruction as well as through the fostered community.</p>

<p>Target Audience: The target audience for this project is elementary educators and instructional coaches. While many of the people who sign up for this microcredential will likely be less experienced educators trying to ensure they are using best practices, any experience level of educator can benefit from a refresher. Instructional coaches can also take this course in order to give the information from the course to all the educators they work with in their school.</p>

<p>Context and Need: As a former fourth grade reading and writing teacher, I have witnessed firsthand the struggle students are facing with argumentative writing. I also attended the only writing training Orange County Public Schools provides for their teachers and it did not provide many benefits. This microcredential would fill that need and allow teachers a resource to reference and build upon time and time again. </p>

<p>Competencies: After completing my microcredential, the learner will be able to identify the key features of an upper elementary argumentative essay and how to achieve those key features. After completing my microcredential, the learner will be able to teach basic argumentative writing skills to an upper elementary classroom resulting in the student’s success. </p>

<p>Assessment Strategies: Students will demonstrate understanding through the following assessment strategies. First, they will have interactive quizzes to demonstrate understanding of the pieces of argumentative writing. Next, they will have case studies and interactive scenarios to demonstrate applications of their learning. Finally, they will have discussion boards to foster collaboration and community amongst the learners.</p> 

<p>Outcome: After completing this microcredential, educators and instructional coaches will be empowered and filled with knowledge to instruct upper elementary students on writing argumentative writing pieces. They will have a community to collaborate ideas with as well.</p>
