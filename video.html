                <p>This video, created using Inkscape and iMovie, demonstrates how to solve a long division problem aligning with the B.E.S.T. mathematics standard MA.4.AR.2.2: Given a mathematical or real-world context, write an equation involving multiplication or division to determine the unknown whole number with the unknown in any position. Before creating my video, I created 18 high resolution images on Inkscape that demonstrated solving a word problem with long division. In iMovie, I added the Kens Burns effect on two of my images. I zoomed in on the times table chart to emphasize it and then zoomed out in the next image to demonstrate the problem being used. I also included transitions and the “blast” clip filter for my countdown between the practice problem and its results. I wanted to make it clear that learners interacting with the video should pause it if they are working out the problem. I also included screen captions for both times I referenced my multiplication chart. As this is the easiest visual to demonstrate how I solved the problem, I utilized it over other methods. I wanted to make sure learners know they are not required to include a multiplication chart and noted it for both with red captions that expanded in the lower right corner. I also integrated a formal title and credits with iMovie’s built in screens. I also incorporated narration throughout the entire video for students who struggle with visual presentation alone. I included playful background music during the video in every part but the title. For the title I chose “broadcast news short” music to capture attention. This project challenged me as it was the first time I created a video in this academic context. I have created personal videos for my social media accounts and recorded presentations or me discussing a topic, but I have not incorporated both images and narration before. I was able to learn a variety of video editing techniques from this project as well as identifying how to make the videos engaging. I went through many iterations of my script before I came up with a thorough but engaging demonstration of solving long division problems. This product, like the other products I have made for this class, was made with the goal of alleviating stress from teachers. Math intervention groups are becoming more and more commonplace in elementary classrooms. By providing teachers with an instructional video that includes a practice problem with the answer, students can watch and interact with this video then complete a worksheet ideally independently. The video refreshes for the students how to solve long division problems without the teacher having to reteach. This project also helped me confirm I still have in-depth knowledge of mathematics standards and how to teach them as I currently teach English Language Arts. All in all, this project tested me in many ways, but it was also a delight to uncover the finished product and understand how helpful it is. </p>
