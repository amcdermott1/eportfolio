                <p> Within my academic career at the University of Florida, I embarked on an inquiry project focusing on how technology can improve the classroom. My focus during this project was upper elementary writing, as the students I was teaching were struggling with writing complex paragraphs based on a prompt and text evidence. During this project, I conducted multiple forms of data collection as well as multiple forms of data analysis. This project challenged my notions as an educator and reminded me the importance of seeing each student as an individual. It also enlightened to me that most of my students were naturally independent and students learn in a variety of ways. When interacting with my presentation that summed up my results, you will note that I utilized the Canvas LMS in order to create the educational technology piece for my students. This is only a small portion of the LMS work I have done during my multiple years as an educator. </p>
