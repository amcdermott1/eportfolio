                <p> <b>I created two separate assessments,<a href="https://amcdermott1.github.io/Quiz/" target="_blank">
                   a quiz assessment on types of sentences</a> and <a href="https://amcdermott1.github.io/dragndrop/" target="_blank">
                    a drag-n-drop assessment on informational text structures.</a> Click the assessment you are interested in to interact with it.</b></p>
                <p>My quiz assessment on types of sentences was created on GitHub by utilizing a repository.  This quiz aligns with the B.E.S.T. ELA standards ELA.2.C.3.1, ELA.3.C.3.1, ELA.4.C.3.1, and ELA.5.C.3.1, with the third and fourth grade standards aligning the mostly closely to this quiz. All four of these standards are worded the same: Follow the rules of standard English grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling appropriate to grade level.  In terms of creating this quiz, I utilized HTML and Javascript follows. Within the HTML file, I created a new title for the quiz and changed the title and background color of the page. I included more line breaks to separate text and added a horizontal line to identify the footer. Within the javascript file, I increased the number of questions to 10 and ensured they all reflected either sentence fragments, run-on sentences, or complete sentences. I also updated the automated correct responses to reflect the slang words (sigma and cooking) my students use. This adds in a piece of engagement as students will be eager to find the slang words and enjoy seeing that the resources they use to learn can also reflect their personalities. I also updated the start over button to say try again as it is more positive. I also have a box appear at the end declaring students sentence structure identification masters. My final piece to this quiz was to include a pop-up box that populates when the website loads with the following text “Before you begin, don't forget the following: A sentence fragment is missing part of a sentence, a run-on sentence needs a conjunction or to be split in two, and a compound sentence is two independent clauses connected with a conjunction." This friendly reminder helps make this quiz a more independent task. This project challenged me as it was my first time working with code. I was excited when it worked properly, but also frustrated when the adaptations didn’t appear correctly the first time. This project, especially when trying to find a hosting platform that works, tested my patience and I perserved. I am now much more fluent in code, as you will see with the next assessment I created. ></p>
                <p>My second assessment was to create a drag-n-drop assessment. Focusing on standards ELA.3.R.2.1 and ELA.4.R.2.1, I created an assessment that has students moving key phrases from different text structures to the correct text structure. At the top of the quiz, like my last quiz, I added in a helpful reminder: Remember that key words are not the only way to identify a text structure, and you should look at the whole text as well. For this reminder, I wanted it to be ever present to remind students to look at the text as a whole, not just one part. To challenge myself more with this project, I changed the font style to fantasy as well as bolded the reminder. I changed the colors to tie in with this fantasy theme. To mirror my first quiz, when you complete the quiz with 100% accuracy, a text box populates saying “Congratulations! You are a text structure identification master!” I also changed the directions to note that each key word should go into the appropriate text structure box. I also created three new boxes as the fourth grade B.E.S.T. text structure standards focus on 6 text structures: comparison, cause and effect, problem and solution, sequence, description, and chronology. I also duplicated the number of key words to ensure every box had three appropriate key words. This project challenged me to further my use of code and it became easier. I am now more adept in the simple changes and how to ensure there is not a break in the code. This project also helped me ensure I was aligning properly to standards. As an educator looking to transition into the curriculum development field, it is crucial to me that everything I make aligns with standards. This helps ease teachers’ minds and ensure they do not need to worry about vetting the resources I create; they will always align with standards. </p>
