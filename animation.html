                <p>Before creating my animation, I first ensured it aligned with Florida B.E.S.T. standard SC.4.L.17.3: Trace the flow of energy from the Sun as it is transferred along the food chain through the producers to the consumers. I utilized Canva to find gifs and vector images of a sun, grass, rabbit, fox, and arrows. The arrows and sun were both gifs. The grass I added in a transition to have it grow with the sun's energy. I used a custom path for both the rabbit and the fox to mimic their movements. I included a “match to move” transition between the third and fourth image. I then went to iMovie where I added in narration explaining how the energy transfers in the path of the arrows. I also added in a transition between the title page and beginning of the food chain. This project contributed to my ever growing skill set in content creation. I was challenged to focus on how to not only engage students in what is created as well as align with standards. The simple labels also ensure students know what the vocabulary term for each piece of the food chain is, a key feature of the standard. While this was fairly simple for me to create via Canva, the outcome of a 10 second animation does not necessarily feel as though it is sustainable for creating many animations. Educators often do not have time to spend tedious time on these animations, and a curriculum material developer could ease this pressure off of teachers. This skill of understanding how to create animations in a way that is straightforward but also engaging will be useful in my future career.  </p>
